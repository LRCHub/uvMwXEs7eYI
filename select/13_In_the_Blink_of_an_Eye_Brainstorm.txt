When will it end, now I'm falling
Falling at the seams
I'm running through life
I'm trying to reach, reach my dreams

Somehow I can understand
How can I deny
I never meant to cause you pain
Remaining cries

Get me out of this hole
I just can't help it
Living loaded
With my back on the wall

You understand
Miss the touch of your hand
And come over me
Blink of an eye
You understand
Miss the touch of your hand
And take all of me
Blink of an eye

I'll go somewhere where I can breathe
Breathing on my own
Why do you save all the trouble
And pull yourself down

What's taken away is the price you pay
My heart got lost
Tomorrow will be gone

Before you know my trust

Wish all hatred could disappear
The loss of feeling
Enter me
I could see more clear

You understand
Miss the touch of your hand
And come over me
Blink of an eye, eye
You understand
Miss the touch of your hand
And take all of me
Blink of an eye

You understand
Miss the touch of your hand
And come over me
Blink of an eye, eye
You understand
Miss the touch of your hand
And take all of me
Blink of an eye

You understand
Miss the touch of your hand
Come over me
Blink of an eye, blink of an eye
You understand
Miss the touch of your hand
Take all of me
Blink of an eye
