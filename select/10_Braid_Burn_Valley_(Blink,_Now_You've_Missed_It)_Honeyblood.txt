Down in the Braidburn Valley,
Looks like the weathers turned.
When the air gets foggy,
The Castle in the skyline goes blurred.
All the joggers have jogged on home.
Dog walkers and have thrown their bones.
Here, the valley carries a lowly tone.
And only the blackbirds and crows know how the song goes.
I walk up the hill holding on my red raw knees,
As the wind knocks them in the breeze.
The black iron bench is standing still
Just as it was the last time I felt this ill.
I trace my thumb over where
I carved my name
Somewhere I feel so ashamed.
A love lost is a knotch gained.
I could always scratch it out
If I had initials to replace.
Another fucking bruise,
But this one looks just like a rose.
Oh, in this valley I will do my haunting
When I become a ghost.
Another fucking bruise,
But this one look just like a rose.
Just like a rose.
